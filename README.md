# ELASTIC SIEM HOMELAB
# Elastic SIEM Home Lab ‚Äî Threat Simulation & Detection Engineering

## üìå Overview
This project sets up an **Elastic SIEM home lab** using **Elastic Cloud** and a **Kali Linux attacker machine**. The aim was to simulate real-world adversary activity, write **custom detection rules**, and validate SOC workflows end-to-end ‚Äî from log collection to **email alerting** and triage.

By recreating attacker behavior in a controlled lab, the project demonstrates **detection engineering**, **SOC analysis**, and **incident response readiness**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Lab Setup
- **Elastic Cloud Deployment** ‚Äî hosted Elasticsearch + Kibana.
- **Elastic Agent Enrollment** ‚Äî Elastic Defend installed on endpoints to collect process, authentication, and network telemetry.
- **Kali Linux Attacker Machine** ‚Äî used for simulating scans, brute force, and exploitation.
- **Alerting & Notifications** ‚Äî configured rule-based alerts with **email delivery** to analyst inbox.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Deploy a fully functional Elastic SIEM environment.  
- Generate attacker activity and ensure visibility in Elastic Defend telemetry.  
- Write **custom detection rules** and map them to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.  
- Validate SOC workflows by triggering **alerts and email notifications**.  

---

## üîç Detection Rules Implemented
1. **Nmap Scan Detection**  
   - Triggered on reconnaissance activity from Kali (e.g., port scanning).  
   - **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1046 ‚Äî Network Service Scanning  

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**  
   - Detected processes like `netcat` and `curl` launched from unexpected contexts.  
   - **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1059 ‚Äî Command and Scripting Interpreter  

3. **Brute-Force Authentication**  
   - Alerted on repeated login failures followed by a successful logon.  
   - **MITRE ATT&CK:** T1110 ‚Äî Brute Force   

---

## üìä Results
- Generated **100+ alerts** across reconnaissance, brute force, and privilege escalation scenarios.  
- Successfully detected **port scans, suspicious processes, and brute-force logins** from attacker machine.  
- Reduced **false positives** by tuning rules (whitelisting expected admin activity).  
- Configured **email notifications** ‚Äî rules delivered alerts directly to analyst inbox, proving real SOC workflow.  
- Visualized events in **Kibana dashboards**, aiding quick triage.
